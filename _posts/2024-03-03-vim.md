## In case of emergency

* Quit Vim: `:q`
* Quit Vim anyway: `:q!`
* Help: `F1` (quit help: `:q`)
* Help about **command**: `:help command`
* If the requested command name is incomplete, use `TAB` for auto completion of `CTRL+d` to get the list of available commands

## Vim modes
* Normal mode: `ESC`
* Insert mode, before or after cursor: `i` or `a`
    * Replace mode: `R`
* Visual mode: `v` ("cursor visual") or `V` ("line visual")
* Command mode: `:`

## Navigate {#nav_main}
### Navigate in a file
* Move cursor: left, down, up, right: `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, respectively; can be preeceded by a number.
* Go to the start or end of line: `0` or `$`
* Go to start or end of block: `ALT+{` or `ALT+}`

* Go to next word: `w`
* Go to end of word: `e`
* Go to previous word: `b`
* Go to beginning of current word: `b`
* Go to next or previous pattern under cursor: `*` or `#`
* Go to matching bracket when on `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `<`, or `>`: `%`

Apart from `%`, these commands can be preceeded by a number; e.g. `5 w` goes _5 words_ forward.

### Search
* Search for a word: `/word`
* Backward search: `?word`

* When in visual mode, most of the [navigation commands](#nav_main) above will select the relevant text; e.g. `vG` will select text from cursor to the end of the file.
* Save selection to **filename**: `:w filename`
* Copy selected text: `y`
* Delete selected text: `d`
* Paste the copied selection before or after cursor or line: `P` or `p`

### Deletion
* Delete char under cursor: `x`
* Delete current line: `dd` (or `Vd`)
* Delete **n** lines: `ndd`
* In addition, `d` can be combined to most of the [navigation commands](#nav_main) above, e.g. `d0` will delete text from cursor position to the beginning of the line;

### Replacement
* Replace char under cursor with **a**: `ra`
* Replace mode: `R` and overwrite; `ESC` when finished

See also [substitution commands](#subst) below.

Default methods for highlighting are found in file `/usr/share/vim/vim<version>/syntax/syncolor.vim`{: .filepath}; I edit this file when I don't want things like special words being highlighted in bold.

Additional keywords can be highlighted for a given language, e.g. `C`:

```console
cat ~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim 
syn keyword msType QWORD DWORD WORD BYTE
syn keyword msType BOOL HANDLE PSLIST_HEADER HWND ATOM HBRUSH WNDCLASSA
syn keyword msConstant TRUE FALSE WM_CLOSE WM_DESTROY WM_TIMER

hi link msType cType
hi link msConstant cConstant
```

New color schemes can be installed. I put the one I'm using in `/usr/share/vim/vim<version>/colors/`{: .filepath}.
