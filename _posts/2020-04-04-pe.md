# Context

Information related to the PE header I collected here and there. My favorite resources on the subject, however, are Goppit and Iczelion's tutorials (both available on [tuts4you](https://tuts4you.com/download/category/30/ "tuts4you")), but it's just a personal preference.
Pictures are made with [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn) and are freely reusable.

# Reaching the Data Directories {#data_directories}

In a classical PE file, we find at offset `0x3C` the field **e\_lfanew**. The value it contains is the offset to the **NtHeaders** structure ([**IMAGE\_NT\_HEADERS**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnt/ns-winnt-image_nt_headers32 "MSDN") in the MSDN), where we find the famous `PE\x00\x00` signature. At offset `PE+0x78` starts the **Data Directories** ([Optional Header Data Directories](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#optional-header-data-directories-image-only "MSDN") in the MSDN), which is an array of **IMAGE\_DATA\_DIRECTORY** structures:

```c
typedef struct _IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY {
    DWORD   VirtualAddress;
    DWORD   Size;
} IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY;
```
> _Note that VirtualAddress is in fact a RVA._

The first entry allows getting the RVA and size of the **export table** ([Export Directory Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#export-directory-table) in the MSDN), while the second allows getting the RVA and size of the **import table** ([Import Directory Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#import-directory-table) in the MSDN). In short:

* PE+0x78 = export table RVA
* PE+0x7C = export table Size
* PE+0x80 = import table RVA
* PE+0x84 = import table Size

# Export table {#export_table}

The export table lists the functions a given PE file (often a DLL) makes available to other PE files. For example, if the dynamic library _lib1.dll_ exports the function _funct1_, any executable code can call _funct1_. The figure below depicts an overview of the export table:
[![pe-export-table](/assets/cheatsheets/pe/resized_export_table.png)](/assets/cheatsheets/pe/export_table.png)

1. Focusing on the red part of the figure, we see the **IMAGE\_EXPORT\_DIRECTORY** structure has 11 fields, but only a part will be of interest here (this structure can be accessed with the RVA at `PE+0x78`, see [above](#data_directories)):
    1. **NameRVA** is the RVA of the name of the module (here the string "KERNEL32.DLL"). 
    2. **NumberOfFunctions** is the total count of functions exported by the module. 
    3. **NumberOfNames** is the total count of named functions exported by the module.
2. The next important field is **AddressofFunctions**: this is the RVA of the **ExportAddressTable** (green part of the figure). Each entry in the ExportAddressTable is also an RVA, and it can points either to (i) code or (ii) a string:
    1. if it points to code, this is the code executed when calling a given API. In the figure above, the RVA at ExportAddresstable[2] allows reaching the code of the function _AcquireSRWLockExclusive_.
    2. if an entry in the ExportAddressTable points to a string, we're dealing with a **forwarded export**. On my laptop, for example, the entry corresponding to the API _HeapAlloc_ in _kernel32.dll_ points to the string "_NTDLL.RtlAllocateHeap_". This means any call to _HeapAlloc_ in a given program will be forwarded to the API _RtlAllocateHeap_ exported by _ntdll.dll_ (see also the [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#export-address-table)). This feature abused [here](/series/pma/pma-Lab01-01) for example.
3. The last two important fields are **AddressOfNames** and **AddressOfNamesOrdinal**: both are RVA, pointing to the arrays **ExportNamePointerTable** and **ExportOrdinalTable**, respectively (blue part of the figure).
    1. **ExportNamePointerTable** is an array of RVAs pointing to strings. These strings are the public names we use when calling functions by their name and are located in a table called **ExportNameTable**.
    2. **ExportOrdinalTable**: an array of _words_, where each word is the index of an RVA inside the ExportAddressTable. Often, we parse the ExportOrdinalTable and the ExportNamePointerTable in parallel.


Let's illustrate this by finding the API _AquireSRWLockExclusive_ (follow with the figure):
* parse the ExportNamePointerTable and the ExportOrdinalTable in parallel;
* for each entry in the ExportNamePointerTable, do a string comparison with the name of the API we want;
* when the correct entry is found, get its index: on the figure its ExportNamePointerTable[0];
* use this index to retrieve the correct word in the ExportOrdinalTable: ExportOrdinalTable[0] = 0x0002
* use this word as an index in the ExportAddressTable: ExportAddressTable[2] = RVA of AquireSRWLockExclusive.

# Import table {#import_table}

Import table of an executable lists external functions a PE needs to run. The figure below depicts an overview of the import table:
[![pe-import-table](/assets/cheatsheets/pe/resized_import_table.png)](/assets/cheatsheets/pe/import_table.png)

Information is split in 3 parts (red, blue and green on the figure):

1. Looking at the red part, we have the **IMAGE\_IMPORT\_DESCRIPTOR** structure that can be accessed from the RVA at `PE+0x80` (see [above](#data_directories)). In a classical PE, there are as many IMAGE\_IMPORT\_DESCRIPTOR structures as DLL this PE depends on. For example, if a PE uses APIs exported by _kernel32.dll_, _ws2\_32.dll_, and _msvcrt.dll_, the RVA at `PE+0x80` will points to an array of 3 IMAGE\_IMPORT\_DESCRIPTOR structures.

    Three fields are of interest here: 
    1. **Name1**: the RVA of the name of the DLL exporting the required APIs
    2. **OriginalFirstThunk**: an array of RVAs (in fact an array of **IMAGE\_THUNK\_DATA**, but let's take a shortcut), each pointing to an **IMAGE\_IMPORT\_BY\_NAME** structure
    3. **FirstThunk**: before imports resolution (when the PE is on disk), it's a copy of the OriginalFirstThunk; after imports resolution (after a PE has been loaded in memory), it's an array of virtual addresses pointing to the entrypoints of APIs.

    Both OriginalFirstThunk and FirstThunk should be considered before (blue part) and after (green part) imports resolution.
2. The blue part shows OriginalFirstThunk and FirstThunk before imports resolution: both are arrays of RVAs pointing to IMAGE\_IMPORT\_BY\_NAME structures: 
```c
typedef struct _IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME {
    WORD    Hint;
    BYTE    Name[1];
} IMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME, *PIMAGE_IMPORT_BY_NAME;
```
This field **Name** in this structure is the name of the API to import (let's ignore **Hint** for the moment).
3. After imports resolution (green part), the RVAs of the FirstThink are replaced by virtual addresses of the APIs.

# RVA to offset

use the sections table and find which section should contain the value of the RVA:
if section.start <= RVA < section.end, bingo. then black magic:

```
(RVA - section_virtual_address) + section_raw_address
```
